## 📌 What This Is

A living showcase of how I’m rethinking IT Support and SysAdmin practices using:

- 🧠 **ChatOps** for RCA, incident response, and SOP generation  
- 📊 **Monitoring workflows** across Prometheus, Datadog, and hybrid environments  
- 🧾 **ERP/POS support automation** for business-critical systems  
- 🤖 **AI-powered documentation** that speaks the language of stakeholders

## 🔮 Why It Matters

Support should be **proactive**, not reactive.  
Documentation should be **living**, not forgotten.  
And sysadmins should be **architects of clarity** — not just fixers of chaos.

This repo is my contribution to that future.
