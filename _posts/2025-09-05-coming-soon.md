# 🧾 Coming Soon — ChatOps Meets ERP & POS: Automating Support in Business-Critical Systems

ERP and POS systems are the backbone of business operations — from procurement to payments, inventory to insights. But supporting them often means navigating complex workflows, scattered documentation, and high-stakes incidents.

I’ve worked across **Dynamics NAV**, **Stalis POS/MIS**, and multi-branch retail setups. Now, I’m bringing **ChatOps automation** into the mix.

---

## 🔍 The Opportunity

- **ERP workflows** are rich in logic but poor in visibility.
- **POS systems** generate frequent, high-impact incidents — often under pressure.
- Support teams need faster RCA, clearer documentation, and smarter escalation.

---

## 🧪 What I’m Building

- **ChatOps flows** for common ERP/POS incidents:
  - Procurement errors
  - Payment gateway failures
  - SQL deadlocks and data sync issues
- **Automated RCA templates** triggered by chat commands
- **SOP generation** using AI — tailored to business processes
- **Incident tagging** for audit trails and SLA tracking

---

## 🧠 Sample Use Case (Preview)

> A payment fails at POS terminal #12.  
> ChatOps bot detects the error via log parser → posts to support channel:  
> “⚠️ Payment failure at POS-12 | Gateway timeout | Last sync: 2h ago”  
> Bot links to SOP: “How to resolve gateway timeouts”  
> Engineer follows steps → RCA auto-generated → stored in ERP support wiki.

---

## 🔮 What’s Coming

- A full walkthrough of ChatOps flows for **NAV procurement errors**
- RCA automation for **POS sync failures**
- AI-generated SOPs for **ERP onboarding and troubleshooting**
- A public GitHub repo with **workflow templates and RCA scripts**

---

ERP and POS support shouldn’t be a black box.  
It should be **documented**, **automated**, and **conversation-ready**.

Stay tuned — I’m building the future of business-critical support, one workflow at a time.
