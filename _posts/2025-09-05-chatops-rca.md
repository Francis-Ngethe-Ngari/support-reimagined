# 🧠 ChatOps for RCA — Automating Incident Narratives with PowerShell + AI

In traditional IT Support, RCA (Root Cause Analysis) often feels like a postmortem chore — slow, manual, and disconnected from the actual incident flow. But what if RCA could be conversational, automated, and stakeholder-friendly?

Welcome to my ChatOps experiment.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

- RCA reports are often delayed, inconsistent, or overly technical.
- Stakeholders struggle to understand what happened and why.
- Support teams spend hours rewriting what they already resolved.

---

## ⚙️ My Approach

Using **PowerShell**, basic **LLM prompts**, and a simulated **ChatOps bot**, I built a flow that:

1. **Captures incident metadata** (timestamp, affected system, resolution steps).
2. **Triggers RCA generation** via a chat command (`/rca generate`).
3. **Uses AI to summarize** the incident in plain English — tailored for business stakeholders.
4. **Stores the RCA** in a shared knowledge base (Markdown or Confluence-ready).

## 🧪 Sample Flow

```powershell
# Triggered after incident resolution
$incident = @{
    System = "Windows Server 2019"
    Issue = "AD Account Lockout"
    Resolution = "Unlocked via ADUC; user educated on password sync"
    Timestamp = Get-Date
}

# Generate RCA prompt
$rcaPrompt = "Summarize this incident for a stakeholder: $($incident.Issue) on $($incident.System)..."

# Simulated AI response
$rcaSummary = Invoke-LLM -Prompt $rcaPrompt
Write-Output $rcaSummary

> “On September 5th, a user experienced an AD account lockout due to password mismatch across devices. The issue was resolved promptly, and the user was guided on syncing credentials. No systemic faults detected.”

## 💡 Why It Matters

- **Time-saving**: No more manual RCA drafting.  
- **Clarity**: Stakeholders get digestible summaries without technical jargon.  
- **Scalability**: Works across Windows, Linux, ERP, and cloud incidents.  
- **Empowerment**: Support engineers can focus on resolution, not paperwork.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- Integrating with **Slack or Teams** for real-time RCA triggers.  
- Expanding to **ERP/POS workflows** and **SQL-based incidents**.  
- Building a public **RCA template library** for support teams.  
- Exploring **LLM fine-tuning** for domain-specific RCA generation.

If you're a sysadmin, support engineer, or DevOps lead — this is your invitation to rethink how we communicate incidents.  
**ChatOps isn’t just about automation. It’s about clarity, empathy, and speed.**
